CNC 4 ME

I have been machining for 15+ years and coding for even longer. I wanted a place to centralize and focus all my work on the subject into one location. Github is a great platform, so I started `CNC4ME` the organization that can house all my projects relating to being a CNC machinist.

Head over to [the Github org page](https://github.com/cnc4me/) and check it out!
