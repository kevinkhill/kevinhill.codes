Almost a decade ago I needed a chart.

I needed a chart on a webpage and I was stuck. At the time there wasn't a good solution to my problem. I found a few libraries, but they didn't integrate with my framework of the time, CodeIgniter. I liked using Google Charts, but I had to write the Javascript in the view. I really wanted a way to get the config up into the controller, so we could just have the script output with the view, all ready to go!

I set out on my own to make my first package! This is how [Codeigniter-gCharts](https://github.com/kevinkhill/Codeigniter-gCharts) was born.

I had been [scripting for a while](https://github.com/kevinkhill/ikariam/blob/master/intercity-trading.js) in GreaseMonkey for an online game, Ikariam. I used my cobbled together javascript knowledge and made this [horrible function to concat a bunch for raw JS strings together](https://github.com/kevinkhill/Codeigniter-gCharts/blob/master/libraries/Gcharts.php#L482) which actually ran in the page and made a chart. I was so excited.

To be continued...
